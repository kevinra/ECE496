Q. Any I2C data interpretation protocols needs to be determined for BBB and FPGA communication?
1-8

Q. What would be the difference in input current for 120v, 240v?
to be determined (for single LLC, is there difference in output current for different input v?)

Q. How to shutdown LLCs?
A. Implement timeout on FPGA so that if no master-write for certain period, just turn LLCs off

Q. How to learn user behavior? How should we log user driving time (in terms of data structure)?
<start driving hour> <accul_counter> <user schedule> <distance travelled (avg)>


Q. How to calculate input current for batteries?


Q. Heater ON/OFF determinng logic (for both charging and discharging)?
Charging


Discharging


2 threads using different GPIO -> OK
2 threads using same GPIO or interface (I2C, SPI etc) -> NO (need synchronization)
