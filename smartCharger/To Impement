To Impement:

<BBB>
error uploading feature
I2CWrapper
Test with InputVoltDependents.cpp
electricity price & calculating input current

If necessary
  - device tree for GPIO/I2C

+Future Improvements+
  SQLite write - make it asynchronous
  BBB user pattern learning resistent to outliers
  BBB quering website for electricity price (it's currently hard coded)
  Website --> BBB user schedule notification/fetching


<Server>

+Future Improvements+
  Parsing a website to get electricity price from: 
    <http://www.ontario-hydro.com/index.php?page=current_rates>

  Program to communicate with BBB so that BBB does not need to spend time writing on server's disk. The program would simply reply with ACK to whatever BBB has sent immediately and file write operation will be done by this program.
